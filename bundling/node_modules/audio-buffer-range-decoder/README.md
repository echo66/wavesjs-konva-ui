## API

```js
var RangeDecoder = require('audio-buffer-range-decoder')
```

### `var decodeRange = RangeDecoder(filePath, options, onLoad)`

Specify `filePath` on disk. Opens the file ready for access. 

`onLoad(err, meta)` is called when meta data has loaded.

Returns a `decodeRange` function.

*Options:*
 - `fs`: pass in [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) implementation (required)
 - `audio`: instance of `AudioContext` to use for decoding (required)

### `decodeRange(startTime, duration, callback)`

Pass in `startTime` and `duration` in seconds. `callback(err, audioBuffer)` will be called when data has been decoded or an error has occurred.

### `decodeRange.close()`

Call this when you are done reading to close the underlying file descriptor.
